# Change Request Form - SIMS Project

## CR-003: Implement Student Registration Module with Form Validation

**Date:** December 28, 2025  
**Submitted By:** Gelead Worku  
**Priority:** High  
**Status:** Implemented

---

## 1. Description of Change

### What needs to be changed?
Create a comprehensive student registration module in React that includes a multi-field form with client-side validation. The form should collect student information (ID, name, email, phone, department, year, GPA) and submit data to the Laravel backend API. Include validation for email format, phone number format, and required fields.

### Why is this change needed?
Student registration is a core functionality of the SIMS application. Without a proper registration module, administrators cannot add new students to the system. Form validation prevents invalid data from being submitted to the database, ensuring data integrity and improving user experience by providing immediate feedback on input errors.
